 *
 * SEAT ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING under pair-then-tiebreak voting: seats 0 and 1

 * highest-frequency noise-killers — and fleet keep rates jumped from a
 * measured 42% to 60-90% within a day. The pair is now mechanism + scope;
 * checkability breaks ties. "The decision function is identical" was true of
 * the arithmetic and false of seat attention.
 *
 * A lens is added scrutiny, never exclusive jurisdiction. The first version
 * read as jurisdiction, and a strictly literal model (Muse Spark) voted only
 * its own ground — which breaks the arithmetic: each ground has exactly one
 * seat, so a finding failing only one ground loses one vote and survives 1-2
 * by construction. Intent-restatements became mathematically unkillable, and
 * a claim this reviewer had hand-verified as false survived a unanimous
 * panel. Every seat must vote every ground; the lens only says where to dig

 * Refutation must be grounded, not merely doubtful.
 *
 * The first version ended with "If you are uncertain, refute it." Combined with
 * majority rule that is a very high bar, because a skeptic reading a diff in
 * isolation is almost always somewhat uncertain, and two such skeptics sink a
 * finding. It showed: on a process-cleanup pull request, candidates describing
 * locale-dependent `ps` parsing and incomplete POSIX subtree kills were both
 * dropped 2-to-1, and both correspond to issues the paid reviewer flagged as
 * Major on the same lines.
 *
 * Requiring a stated reason keeps the skepticism while removing the bias.
 * "I cannot confirm this from the diff alone" stops being a rejection, which is
 * right: it is an argument about the reviewer's information, not about the
 * code. The 3-of-3 rejections under the old prompt (a claimed undefined in a
 * toast title, a variable said to be out of scope that would not have compiled)
 * are exactly the kind that still fail this version, because a concrete reason
 * they are wrong is easy to name.
 *
 * The vagueness ground closes the hole that opened up with it. Demanding a
 * specific reason to refute hands unfalsifiable claims a free pass: "other
 * callers may silently break" survived 3-0 not because anyone verified it but
 * because there is nothing specific to argue against. Generation is already
 * told to name a mechanism, so without the matching ground here the two halves
 * disagreed about what counts as a finding, and the vaguest claims sailed
 * through the gate built to stop them.
