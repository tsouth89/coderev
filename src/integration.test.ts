/**
 * End-to-end tests against a local fake provider speaking real SSE.
 *
 * The unit tests cover pure logic, but every production failure this tool has
 * actually had was in the transport: a non-streaming request killed mid-flight
 * (reported as a clean review), a vendor reporting the same cached-token count
 * in two fields (halved the cost figure), a stream that needed line-buffered
 * reassembly. None of that is reachable from a pure function, so these tests
 * stand up a real HTTP server, stream real chunked SSE at the real client, and
 * assert on what reviewDiff returns.
