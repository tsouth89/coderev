 * DeepSeek returned ECONNRESET, and behind a proxy it would be a 504. The

 * in 195s.
 *
 * So a total-duration timeout is the wrong instrument. It cannot tell a model
 * that is working from one that has hung, and tuning it means picking between
 * killing good long reviews and waiting forever on dead ones. An idle timeout

 * can spend longer on that than on the whole rest of the response. Arming the
